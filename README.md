We owe gratitude to one another, the surviving members of this team, for the grit and tenacity exhibited to meet the project deliverables within the deadline. We started as a 5-member team and lost 2 members at the very beginning of the project. We pulled together, encouraged each other, and sacrificed additional hours in order to fulfill the project requirements. Thatâ€™s TEAMWORK at its best!
